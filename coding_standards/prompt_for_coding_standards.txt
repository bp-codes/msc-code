I want to apply coding standard to code across multiple projects.

Aim:

- Apply a consistent style to multiple codes.
- At some point the number of lines and complexity of the code will be measured.
- When applying these standards, the functionality must not be changed.

Should do:

- Complete doxygen comments
- Use auto and initialise with {} e.g. auto counter {std::size_t(0)};
- Check proper use of const, passing references, inline, nodiscard, noexcept

For now:

- Don't do anything else.
- Don't change variable names.
- Don't change any functionality.


I will upload the coding standards.
